      Most people have experienced the scenario when that superstar intern delivers the impossible, or that external consultant finally found a solution to a longing problem. You get excited, celebrate, and two years later when an update is required, you have absolutely no idea how it works or was even built in the first place. 
    </p>
    <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
      Your once elegant solution is now trapped in the hands of the innovators. Even worse, the person who developed it may have forgotten how they did it in the first place. 
    </p>
    <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
      This is why, at Protocat Labs, each project also comes hand in hand with documentation that enables a full replication of the project. This documentation takes time, so we charge extra for it as you may see in your proposal, but it's compulsory. And if for some reason your finance team kicks up a fuss about it, then remind them of the following points:
    </p>
    <p class="f3 lh-copy measure">
      Reason 1: Innovation Hostage
    </p>
    <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
      This is a huge risk that all projects face when contracting external developers. They go halfway, deliver a sub-par technology, and then when asked for a small change, will ask for further payment to execute that change. Your technology is now held hostage at the hands of the company who developed it for you. 
    </p>
    <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
      At Protocat Labs we find minor modifications incredibly boring, and not worth our time. We would rather you have the full knowledge of how your technology is built and works, thus allowing all minor changes, feature additions, and maintenance to be done in house. Which will save you considerable cost, time, and sanity in the long run. 
    </p>
    <p class="f3 lh-copy measure">
      Reason 2: Hit By the Bus Risk
    </p>
    <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
      "Hit By the Bus" risk is a grim way of explaining the reality that human brains are not great places for storing information. If your external contractor goes bankrupt, or indeed gets hit by a bus, then your project chain is in for some serious issues. Mitigate this risk through continuous documentation.
    </p>
    <p class="f3 lh-copy measure">
      Reason 3: Education has value
    </p>
    <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
      Having your team be up to date with the latest methods through workshops and courses are usually a costly and time-intensive endeavour. By following our methods step by step, your team gets an intensive learning-by-doing course.
