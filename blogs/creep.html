      There has been this idea that you have been dreaming and brooding over for so long...
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      Then, there it is! Your idea is now sitting right in front of your eyes. Your heartbeat increases, pupils dilate and you yell out:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="f5 f5-ns measure">
    <p class="fw9 lh-copy lh-title-ns">"It's amazing! Wow! Imagine how great it would be to add Feature-X!"
    </p>
  </blockquote>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      To which I often reply. Yes, Feature-X would be great, but how you manage Feature-X will either improve or destroy your project.
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      Let me explain:
    </p>
    <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
      Feature-Creep Problem 1: Irrational Decisions
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      Humans, when excited (positively or negatively) often make terrible decisions. Most people know that when feeling anger, that they should wait until they calm down, and then make a decision. In the same way, when one feels excitement, they should also wait, evaluate the goal of the organisation, and then see what the next feasible step is.
    </p>
    <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
      Feature-Creep Problem 2: Team Moral
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      Something that any good tech manager knows is that project closure boosts moral. Completing a project, and signing it off will always make the development team feel good about the work, and get excited about the next assignment. Asking for a project to remain open until Feature-X is implemented will in most cases result in a hacked job. 
    </p>
    <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
      Feature-Creep Problem 3: Bloated Scope
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      When any technology is designed, scope is always taken into account. One lays the foundation to handle the scope. Feature-creep often causes updates to technology without rethinking the foundation, thus causing instability and huge headaches in the future.
    </p>
    <p class="f2 fw2 lh-copy measure">
      So how do you handle those amazing new features?
    </p>
    <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
      Solution 1: Be aware
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      Everyone gets the feature-creep. A good manager has an awareness when something is a feature-creep, and can differentiate it from a thoroughly planned feature request. Have you evaluated whether the feature is in line with your project scope? Have you evaluated multiple features and chosen the best ones based on a risk assessment? Have you slept 7-8 hours before making the decision? If the answer is "No" to any of these, it is likely the creep.
    </p>
    <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
      Solution 2: Agile Development
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      At Protocat Labs, we very rarely propose the final solution in the first iteration. We write our proposals in small iterative steps, which allows for the scope to pivot at each iteration. This way, each iteration (also called a sprint), can be fully delivered. In the end, Feature-X, along with Feature Y and Z can be kept for the next iteration with a new scope, proposal and milestones. 
    </p>
    <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
      Solution 3: Document it
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      When you get that great idea, write it down. You will often have multiple ideas and it is good to keep a tab of them. Once the project is complete, have some sleep, and then evaluate all your great ideas. Conduct a risk assessment to see what you really want to do. From here a discussion can begin for the next best strategy for your project. 
    </p>
    <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
      Solution 4: Bring it in house
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      In very rare situations, should you have an external development team do feature upgrades. Ideally, the development team does the impossible, delivers, and documents their delivery in a way that your in house team can re-build it from scratch. This way, the external development team can't hold you hostage, and internalising simple feature upgrades is often more time and cost-efficient.
